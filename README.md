# Intro-to-DataScience-Project

This is a final project for Syracuse University's Intro to Data Science (IST 687) course.
This project worked with the Customer Satisfaction csv file. The data was cleaned, and analyzed for trends that contribute to customers
unsatisfactory experiences. Multiple linear regression using the Akaike information criterion (AIC), Naive Bayes classification,
and support vector machine algorithms were used in the analysis. In addition to the algorithms employed, many graphs were made using R's ggplot2
package during exploratory data analysis. The full report can be found in the word document.
