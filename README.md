# Intro-to-DataScience-Project

This is a final project for Syracuse University's Intro to Data Science (IST 687) course.
This project worked with the Customer Satisfaction csv file. The data was cleaned, and analyzed for trends that contribute to customers
unsatisfactory experiences. Multiple linear regression using the Akaike information criterion (AIC), Naive Bayes classification,
and support vector machine algorithms were used in the analysis. In addition to the algorithms employed, many graphs were made using R's ggplot2
package during exploratory data analysis. The full report can be found in  Team_Ank_FinalProject TM.docx


# The data "csv sat"

This is the original data set used for the project. It contains nearly 130,000 observations and 28 variables.

# Team_Ank_FinalProject TM.docx
Since this project is a practice in applying data science techniques to the real world, this is a mock write up of a data science consultant firm. Ankylosaurus Consulting was asked to identify strategies to improve customer satisfaction in Southeast Airlines. Answers to the question of how to increase customer satisfaction are inside the document.
